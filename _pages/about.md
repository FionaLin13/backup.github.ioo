## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

**Hi! Iâ€™m a recent Mechanical Engineering graduate from MIT focusing on controls, instrumentation, and robotics**.

**Iâ€™m passionate about designing and building systems that combine hardware and software**: a robot from scratch, a digital system implemented an FPGA, a DRAM on a PCB, or an autonomy system for marine search and rescue vehicles.

**I excel at thinking across disciplines, and Iâ€™m always looking for new ways to bridge physical and digital systems**. I have experience in mechanical design, electronics, embedded systems, and autonomy. I am comfortable both in the machine shop and in my IDE.

**I am interested in roles such as Mechanical Engineer, Robotics Engineer, Mechatronics Engineer, Control Systems Engineer, and Field Engineer**. But Iâ€™m also open to breaking into new fields and tackling new challenges.

Outside of engineering, I love solving puzzles and learning new ideas from others. I also love any chance to use my maker chops to enrich life, such as sewing, crocheting, baking, or making furniture.

Thanks for stopping by â€” feel free to explore my projects, or get in touch at fionalin at mit dot edu!
