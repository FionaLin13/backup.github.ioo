### Tools & Skills Used: 
Verilog, FPGA development, VGA interfacing, memory management, pipelining, embedded systems, modular design

## Goal:
For my digital system laboratory class final project, my teammate and I implemented Conway‚Äôs Game of Life on an field programmable gate array (FPGA). We wanted to make the project challenging by proposing deliverables that would test the limits of our resources (e.g., project time, FPGA memory capacity, clock speed, number of arithmetic units). Our objective was to create an interactive, real-time simulation with live graphics, user input, and audio output while staying within the hardware constraints of the FPGA board.

## My Role & Contributions:
I co-led the architecture design and contributed significantly to both hardware and creative aspects:
- Co-deigned system architecture
- Designed and implemented modules for display output(XVGA signal generator and the renderer), audio output, mouse and keyboard input, and seed kernel selection
- Created all graphic and audio assets, giving the game a unique aesthetic
- Co-write the final report and present the project to the course staff

## Challenges & Solutions:
The biggest hurdle was the memory limitation. We could only store one frame at a time, but needed to compute and display frames concurrently. Insipred by another project, we implemented a ‚Äúchasing the pixel‚Äù style architecture, where each pixel ‚Äúsnaked‚Äù across the screen, pushing data as it went. This let us simulate the next frame with just one additional frame of pixel buffer.

## Outcome: 
The result was a fully functional and visually rich Game of Life with:
- A 480 by 480 grid @ 31fps. This is large enough to require non-trivial implementation, but feasible given our clock speed.
- 12+ starter seeds selectable via keyboard. The seeds are initial patterns that produce exciting effects.
- Live pixel editing via mouse input
- Real-time cell tracking and graphing
- A delightfully demonic soundscape triggered by user input

The project ran flawlessly and impressed our instructors so much they had no follow-up questions.

## What I Learned:
This project deepened my understanding of pipelined memory systems, module-based hardware design, and creative problem-solving under hardware constraints. It also showed me the value of researching and taking inspiration from exisiting work. Sometimes the solution to your problems lies in someone else's tangential project!
