## Summary:
A late-night burst of inspiration (and desperation) led me to build a functional shoerack entirely from workshop scraps. With no CAD, fasteners, or adhesives, I measured my wall space, scouted the workshop, and jam-fit everything together using good old-fashioned friction and some careful hammering.

## Highlights:
- No screws, glue, or nails — entirely held together by tight tolerances  
- Designed and built in one night based on available materials and spatial constraints  
- Still standing and holding shoes months later — shockingly effective  
- A reminder that good engineering doesn’t always require a 3D printer or a spec sheet

## Why it’s here:
Sometimes, engineering is just solving a problem with what you’ve got. This project reflects my hands-on mindset, bias toward action, and comfort with getting messy when needed.
