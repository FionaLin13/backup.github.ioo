## üê° Blobby the Blobfish Pendant

<img title="a title" alt="Alt text" src="/images/blobby_top.jpg">

<em>Figure: Blobby the Blobfish pendant, printed using metal powder 3D printing.</em>

**Type:** Class project (with personal flair)  
**Tools:** Fusion360, metal 3D printing (powder-based)  
**Skills:** Freeform CAD, design for additive manufacturing

This was a small but meaningful project created as part of a class offering $20 in 3D printing credit. I wanted to make it count‚Äîso I chose metal powder printing and decided to create something artistic: a pendant of *Blobby the Blobfish*, a long-time favorite of mine.

At the time, I had just started learning Fusion360. This project was my first exploration into the "Freeform" CAD tool, which is more often used for organic shapes. Making a smooth, lifelike design that was printable and wearable pushed the limits of what I knew. While Fusion360 isn‚Äôt typically used for this kind of sculptural modeling (Blender might have been a better tool), I was able to make it work.

The end result? A custom metal pendant that I still wear today‚Äîand a compliment from a seasoned CAD friend who was impressed I pulled this off in Fusion360 alone.
