**Class:** 2.671 ‚Äì Measurement and Instrumentation  
**Skills:** Experimental design, data analysis, instrumentation, literature review, scientific communication

**Overview**  
As part of MIT's 2.671 course, I designed and conducted a self-directed experiment to investigate the loss of chewiness in tapioca boba pearls over time ‚Äî a common problem I've observed as both a boba enthusiast and home cook. My hypothesis was based on *starch retrogradation*, where starch chains recrystallize over time in the presence of water and sugar, resulting in harder, less pleasant textures.

**Experiment Design**  
To test this, I soaked batches of tapioca pearls in sugar solutions of varying concentrations and measured their texture at regular intervals over 4 hours using an **Instron texture analyzer**. Key metrics included **chewiness, hardness, and cohesiveness**, as defined by the texture analyzer‚Äôs standards. I also conducted informal field interviews with local boba shop owners to understand current preservation strategies.

**Results**  
The data showed that **higher sugar concentrations correlated with increased chewiness and hardness** ‚Äî suggesting sugar content can slow textural degradation. Interestingly, cohesiveness was not significantly affected. These findings point toward actionable improvements in boba storage practices and may help reduce food waste at commercial shops.

**Reflection**  
This project deepened my skills in experimental design, statistical analysis, and working with lab instrumentation. I also practiced synthesizing academic research with real-world questions ‚Äî and of course, enjoyed some boba along the way.
