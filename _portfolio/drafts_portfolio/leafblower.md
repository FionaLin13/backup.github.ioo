# 🍃 Dual-Battery Leaf Blower Redesign – Milwaukee Tool Internship

## Goal
During my Summer 2023 internship at Milwaukee Tool, I redesigned a dual-battery leaf blower with two key objectives:  
1. Reduce weight and improve ergonomics
2. Integrate Milwaukee’s new in-house brushless motor

This also required redesigning the blower fan to optimize performance within new spatial constraints.

## Outcome
At the end of the internship, I presented my final prototype to the company leadership. The final prototype was **30% lighter** than the previous model, with superior ergonomics due to a weight distribution that reduces torque on the wrist (with and without batteries). Moreover, improved aerodynamics resulted in increased airflow.

## My Role & Contributions
I owned the full design pipeline, from research to prototype delivery:
- Analyzed existing Milwaukee and competitor products to identify design inspiration and patent boundaries
- Defined functional requirements based on ergonomic principles, performance goals, and manufacturability
- Identified major weight contributors and restructured battery placement to reduce torque on the user's wrist
- Shaved excess material from the housing while maintaining structural integrity
- Collaborated with the aerodynamics and motor engineering teams to implement a new fan and integrate the in-house motor
- Designed the prototype in Siemens NX, optimized components in ANSYS, and built a physical prototype with 3D-printed parts and off-the-shelf hardware

## Challenges & Solutions
- Fan geometry was extremely difficult to model in CAD; I worked closely with experts and iterated designs to balance realism and printability
- Ensured parts were not just printable, but also moldable — requiring multiple design revisions
- Managed tight timelines by proactively checking in with my manager and resolving bottlenecks quickly

## Tools & Skills Used 
Siemens NX, Teamcenter, ANSYS (FEA and CFD), 3D printing, hand tools, electronics bench equipment, manufacturing design for injection molding

## What I Learned
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with full-cycle mechanical product design, aerodynamic optimization, and design for manufacturing. I also sharpened my skills in project scoping, cross-functional collaboration, and time management — and still finished early enough to study linear algebra and connect with some truly brilliant colleagues.
