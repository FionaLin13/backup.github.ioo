### Languages/Tools:
C++, MOOS-IvP, iMarineSim, GitLab, Emacs

## Goal:
As part of the final competition for Unmanned Marine Vehicle Autonomy class, my team need to program a pair of autonomous marine vehicles to perform a coordinated search and rescue operation for simulated overboard swimmers on the Charles River. The robots need to detect swimmers and relay their position to a rescue vessel, using real-time inter-robot communication and behavior-based autonomy.

## My Role & contributions:
I collaborated with a teammate to develop the behavior for our scout vehicle, while they focused on the rescue vehicle. The scoutâ€™s primary task was to search the area efficiently and communicate detections to the responder. I implemented a zigzag search behavior that prioritized robustness and simplicity â€” a deliberate choice given the limited time for testing and the high variability of real-world deployment conditions.

### Key tasks included:
- Designing and coding the `zigzag` search behavior module in C++
- Handling signal coordination between autonomy modules and vehicles
- Tuning state transitions based on swimmer detection and team signals
- Simulating and testing behaviors in MOOS-IvP before river deployment

## Technical Challenges  
- Getting up to speed with MOOS-IvP and behavior-based autonomy
- Designing a search strategy that balanced reliability and performance
- Debugging behavior transitions and real-time communication issues
- Planning for edge cases and minimizing failure points

## Outcome  
The scout vehicle's simple yet reliable search pattern allowed our team to perform consistently well during the live challenge. While many other systems encountered last-minute bugs, our approach held up under pressure. The project emphasized the importance of robust design, iterative testing, and clear inter-agent communication in autonomous robotics.
