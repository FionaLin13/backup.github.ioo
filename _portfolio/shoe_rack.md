### ðŸªµ Improvised Shoerack

**Summary:**  
A late-night burst of inspiration (and desperation) led me to build a functional shoerack entirely from workshop scraps. With no CAD, fasteners, or adhesives, I measured my wall space, scouted the workshop, and jam-fit everything together using good old-fashioned friction and some careful hammering.

**Highlights:**  
- No screws, glue, or nails â€” entirely held together by tight tolerances  
- Designed and built in one night based on available materials and spatial constraints  
- Still standing and holding shoes months later â€” shockingly effective  
- A reminder that good engineering doesnâ€™t always require a 3D printer or a spec sheet

**Why itâ€™s here:**  
Sometimes, engineering is just solving a problem with what youâ€™ve got. This project reflects my hands-on mindset, bias toward action, and comfort with getting messy when needed.
