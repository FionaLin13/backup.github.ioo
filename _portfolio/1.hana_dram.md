### Tools & Skills Used:
KiCad, SMD soldering, PCB design, Raspberry Pi GPIO interface, electronics fundamentals

## Goal:
As part of MIT‚Äôs 2.679 (Electronics for Mechanical Systems II), the goal was to design, send to manufacture, and hand-solder a custom PCB that interfaces with a Raspberry Pi. The project was open-ended, with only two constraints: Pi compatibility and board size.

## My Role & Contributions: 
I designed a fully custom DRAM circuit using discrete transistors and capacitors, where each capacitor represents one bit. I wanted the bit state to also be visible to the eye, so I added LEDs for each capacitor. For each bit that is on, there will be a corresponding LED that turns on.

### Key tasks included:
- Designing the schematic and PCB in KiCad
- Picking the appropriate resistors, capacitors, and LEDs based on current and voltage limits
- Learning and applying PCB routing best practices (trace width, spacing, organization)
- Creating custom art in layers, including a line-traced drawing of my cat Hana

## Outcome: 
The memory circuit functioned and interfaced with the Pi as expected, but the appropriate resistor values for the LEDs could not be calculated since I could not access datasheets for the LEDs. With insufficent resistance, after the first run all LEDs burnt out. This is an easy fix as I could use different resistors or LEDs. Since the memory system, which I consider the crucical must-have of the system works, I consider this project a success.

The final board was adorable - about 25% of it was Hana. This board would make a great education tool for an introductory computer systems class.

## What I Learned:  
Beyond the technical skills of schematic design and PCB layout, this project taught me the improtance of compartmentization and identifying the "must-haves" vs. "nice-to-haves" in a system. For example, making sure to isolate the LED system with the memory circuit such that in case the LEDs failed, the memory circuit still worked.
