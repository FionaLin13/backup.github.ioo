# ðŸ¤– Capacitive Sensing for Robotic Fingers  
**Type:** Undergraduate Research Â· MIT Biomimetics Lab  
**Skills:** Sensor design, experimental setup, embedded programming, data analysis

## Goal  
As part of my research in the MIT Biomimetics Lab, I investigated the feasibility of using capacitive sensors to enable high-resolution proximity sensing in robotic fingers. The high-resolution proximity sensing enables robotic hands to use forces less than 1 Newton for complex grasping and object manipulation.

## My Role  
I led the design and implementation of a experimental pipeline to characterize sensor performance. I iterated through different geometries for the capacitive sensors and tested the sensor performance for various materials.

**My contributions included:**
- Designing and fabricating mounts to hold sensors and test materials on a horizontal slider jig  
- Prototyping custom capacitive sensors  
- Programming an Mbed microcontroller to read capacitance and control a stepper motor for precise positioning  
- Writing Arduino code to extract raw data from off-the-shelf capacitive sensors  
- Developing a Python script to synchronize system components and analyze the sensor response

## Outcome  
The system achieved a proximity resolution of 0.1 mm, meeting requirements and exceeding the 1 mm resolution target. Based on these results, the lab team decided to pursue further integration of capacitive sensing into their robotic hand platform.

## What I Learned  
This project strengthened my skills in sensor integration, embedded systems, and experimental validation. It also reinforced the importance of interdisciplinary thinking when connecting mechanical design, hardware control, and software analysis in robotics research.
