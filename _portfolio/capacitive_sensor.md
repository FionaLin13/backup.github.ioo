High-resolution sensing on robotic fingers has to potential to enable better grasping by robotic hands. I designed an experiment to evaluate the feasibility of using capacitive sensors for such applications.

In the experiment, objects of various materials are put in the proximity of capacitive sensors of various designs. For the experiment, I designed:
Mounts that hold the sensors and samples on the horizontal slider jig
Capacitive sensors
Mbed program that records capacitance and automatically controls the stepper motor on the jig
Arduino code to extract raw capacitive data from off-the-shelf sensors
Python script to tie all the components together and perform analysis

My system could detect a change in proximity within 0.1 mm, better than the required resolution of 1 mm. My experiment convinced my supervisors to further investigate the integration of capacitive sensors on the existing robotic hand platform.
